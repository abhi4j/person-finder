person-finder
=============

this is a small app I have made while starting with PHP/MySQL.It is some sort of disaster management system.Here I have two interfaces,one for the person who are on the disaster site and they have some information regarding people who are with him/her.S/he can enter the information regarding them in the database through this interface.Second interface is for the people whose relatives are missing and they are searching for them.They can enter whatever information they have and search for their relatives.If their search matches any of the entries then they are provided the phone number to contact and their location so that they can contact the administration and the volunteers who are near the location
